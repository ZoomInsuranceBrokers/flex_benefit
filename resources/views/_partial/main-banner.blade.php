                    Empower your choices with MyBenefits@Zoom, offering enhanced flexibility and a personalized approach to shaping your perks package. Annually, you'll have the opportunity to curate your benefits portfolio during the enrollment period. 
                    The new benefit year will start from 17th Dec 2023 & will be valid till 16th Dec 2024. The benefits you choose will be applicable for the same period.
                    <br>

                    <h3>How does it work</h3>
                    Every employee is automatically enrolled in a foundational set of Core Benefits to prevent inadvertent choices. In addition to this, you will be granted 5000 FlexPoints( 1 flex point to 1 INR ) for a personalized touch to your benefits package. These FlexPoints allow you to tailor your coverage by selecting from various options available. 
                    Should the selected insured benefits surpass the available FlexPoints, any excess will be covered through salary contributions deducted via payroll.
                    <br>

                    <h3>For new hire</h3>
                    For new hires enrolling after December 17, 2023, your coverage will commence from your joining date and extend through 16th Dec 2024 of the subsequent year. The FlexPoints will be prorated based on the joining date.
